## Classes

Create an EVEN class describing a set of even numbers. Class objects are even numbers, which are stored using unsigned integer variables.<br>
Implement:<br>
• default constructor with value n = 2;<br>
• a constructor that sets the value of a class attribute; check if the number in question is even; provide for the generation of a Non_Even exception if this requirement is violated;<br>
• copy constructor;<br>
• input-output of class objects into a stream; when entering, check whether the entered number is even; provide for the generation of a Non_Even exception if this requirement is violated;<br>
• search in a natural sequence of numbers for an even number, next in order with respect to the considered even number;<br>
• search for an even number preceding the considered even number in a natural series of numbers; provide for the generation of the Not_Prev exception if it is impossible to get such a number;<br>
• operations of addition, subtraction and multiplication of two even numbers;<br>
• comparison of two even numbers for equality.<br>
<br>
To test the performance of a class, write a test program in which all the methods of the class are called, both for constant and mutable class objects.
