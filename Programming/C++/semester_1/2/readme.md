## Matrices

<b>Exercise 1.</b>
<br>
The solution to the problem is presented for a static matrix of order N * N or N * M, N <= 10, M <= 10.<br>
Enter the elements of the matrix from the keyboard or set using a random number generator. Form a function to check if a number satisfies a given property.<br>
<br>
Write a program that finds the column with the maximum number of Mersen numbers in the entered matrix of order N * M.
<br>
<br>
<b>Exercise 2.</b>
<br>
Enter the order of the matrix and the elements from the console. Solution to submit for dynamic matrix. Inputting items from a text file is encouraged.<br>
<br>
Write a function that, in a matrix of order N * M, N, M <= 10, shifts the columns of the matrix, consisting entirely of automorphic numbers, to the left column.
