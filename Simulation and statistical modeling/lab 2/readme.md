Simulate a discrete random variable with a given distribution law.
To simulate, use the Maclaurin-Marsagli generator from laboratory work No. 1 with "good" properties (which passed all tests) and the built-in software generator.
Model distribution laws:
1. Bernoulli;
2. Discrete uniform;
3. Binomial;
4. Negative binomial;
5. Geometric;
6. Hypergeometric;
7. Poisson.

Check the simulation accuracy using the output sequence of generators of length n = 10000:

1) Construct a histogram.
2) Implement the Pearson chi-square test (significance level Îµ<sub>0</sub>=0.05).
3) For the Bernoulli distribution over the generated sample, construct a point estimate of the distribution parameter and the confidence interval for the distribution parameter.

The developed software must be implemented in such a way that<br>

The results of the work should be formalized in the form of a report. Report requirements
