Simulate a continuous random variable with a given distribution law.
For simulation use the Maclaurin-Marsagli generator from laboratory work No. 1 with "good" properties (BSV period must be at least 2<sup>24</sup>) and the built-in software generator.
Model distribution laws:
1. Uniform distribution;
2. One-dimensional normal;
3. Lognormal distribution;
4. Exponential distribution;
5. Laplace distribution;
6. Weibull-Gnedenko distribution;
7. Gamma distribution;
8. Beta distribution;
9. Cauchy distribution;
10. Logistic distribution;
11. Chi-square distribution;
12. Student's distribution;
13. Fisher's distribution.

Check the simulation accuracy using the output sequence of generators of length n = 100000:

1) Calculate the sample mean and sample variance;
2) Build a histogram (the number of cells is 1000);
3) Implement the Kolmogorov criterion.
4) Implement Pearson's chi-square test (number of intervals 1000).

The results of the work should be formalized in the form of a report. Report requirements
1. Theoretical material.
2. Results of computational experiments.
3. Conclusions.
