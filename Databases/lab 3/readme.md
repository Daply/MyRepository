This lab requires the design and creation of databases related to different subject areas. During the design process it is necessary:<br>
- to design a database schema at the logical level, using ERwin package or other CASE-tools for this, to meet the requirements for normalization of database tables;<br>
- to form the structure of database tables at the physical level, choose the appropriate names for the tables and their fields.<br>
The student must submit a database design done using the design tool of their choice (for example, an .er1 file when using the ERwin package).<br>
Each student completes one of the proposed tasks. It is allowed for a group of students to present a joint project, but in this case, each member of the group orally gives answers on the constructed project, and the weakest answer is counted.<br>
<br>

● size of the registration fee;<br>
● prize fund for 1st, 2nd and 3rd places;<br>
